This is a take home assignment given by Olcademy. The Problem
Statement is "You need to develop a quiz page where in the data will
be fetched from the database". For the Frontend I have used ReactJs. I
am using firebase firestore to store the quiz data. The submitted
answers are being verified by a serverless function deployed with
vercel.

# Run locally

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProCode2/olcademyQuiz.git
cd olcademyQuiz
```

- Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

- Start development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

`Note`: The serverless function only works when deployed with vercel, try the working demo [here](https://olcademy-quiz.vercel.app)
